The GOAP solution is in the folder "Projet GOAP", and the utility AI solution is in "Projet Utility AI" folder

## Projet GOAP

Multiple world test have been define in "world.h".
Thre's a simplified class diagram called "ClassDiagramGOAP.drawio.png" and a tree of possibility called "PossibilityTreeGOAP.drawio.png" in the GOAP folder.

## Project Utility AI

Variables can be tweaked in the world settings
new actions actors and evaluators can be easily added to change behavior of the AI. 
Only made a few of them to test the algorithm, the result aren't great but seems to work.

so far there is a bug with actor's death, so food consumption per tick is at 0
